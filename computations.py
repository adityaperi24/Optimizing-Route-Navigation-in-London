"""CSC111 Final Project, DataClasses

This python module contains several methods for performing the different computations on the data
extracted from the csv file with the help of methods in classes.py file.
The list of computations done on this data are:

1. A function with outputs a path with the shortest time ( path_with_shortest_time() )

2. A function which calculates and outputs the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm
    ( shortest_route() )

3. A function which outputs all the possible paths between 2 junctions
    ( multiple_path() with helper find_path())

4. A function which calculates and outputs the most direct route between the 2 junctions using
    Breadth First Search Algorithm ( direct_route() )

The GB Road Traffic Counts is produced by the Department for Transport. The Department for Transport
collects traffic data to produce statistics on the level of traffic on roads in Great Britain,
